# Responsive Step Progress Indicator
A Responsive Step Progress Bar based on CSS. We looked around the web and didn't see anything that actually had a responsive element beyond hiding text.
  
## SASS for Easy Color Styling  
There are only 3 colors to make this work. Note that the connecting line, and default boxes are 60% transparent. [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) is great because it allows the use of variables.
  
	  $ProgressBase: rgb(128, 128, 128);  
	  $ProgressComplete: rgb(35, 185, 0);  
	  $ProgressCurrent: rgb(65, 112, 176);
